Pesterchum
==========
This is an unofficial rewrite of Pesterchum to address some flaws.
* Firstly portability, the download is massive for such a simple application, 
and although it does have cross-platform compatability, 
it's still not as good as Java's. 
* Secondly, nothing on it is encrypted, 
it just uses and IRC backend, so mine will have encryption and also user logins. 
* Thirdly the chum roll, it is only saved locally and not on the server, 
meaning the friends list doesn't go well between computers, so mine will have a server side friend list. 

Future
------
When the above goals have been met and it contains all the features possible from
MSPaintAdventures Pesterchum, then we would like to develop an Android version.
